== Securing Endpoints

Every route configured in the gateway is automatically assumed to be a private secure endpoint unless a special custom metadata 'public' is set to true.

For accessing the secure endpoints, the gateway will require a valid JWT token to be passed in the Authorization header.
The token can only be obtained by authenticating with the gateway's authentication service.
The authentication service is a special endpoint that is configured in the gateway and is used to authenticate users and issue JWT tokens.

@startuml

client -> auth: POST /authenticate/
auth -> ums: POST /user/getUserPrincipal
ums -> auth : UserPrincipal
auth -> auth: Generate JWT tokens
auth -> redis: Store refresh token
auth -> client: JWT tokens

=== Rotating JWT Refresh Tokens
Rotating refresh token is used to refresh the JWT token. The refresh token is valid for a lengthy amount of time. The refresh token is sent in the response of the authentication request. The refresh token can be used to get a new JWT token. The refresh token can be used only once to get a new JWT token. The refresh token is invalidated after it is used to get a new JWT token, and new refresh token is sent in the response of the authentication request.
