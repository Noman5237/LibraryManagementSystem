== Why Springboot

. Rapid development: Spring Boot provides a wide range of pre-built components and frameworks that can be easily integrated into your application, allowing you to quickly develop and deploy microservices.

. Easy Configuration: Spring Boot simplifies the configuration of your microservices by providing an opinionated approach to configuration.
This reduces the time required to configure and deploy your application.

. Modular architecture: With Spring Boot, you can develop your microservices using a modular architecture, which makes it easy to break down complex applications into smaller, independent components.

. Scalability: Spring Boot provides support for scaling microservices using cloud-native technologies such as Kubernetes and Docker.
This makes it easy to scale your microservices up or down based on demand.

. Community support: Spring Boot has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development, provide support, and create third-party libraries and plugins.

. Overall, Spring Boot is an excellent choice for building microservices due to its ease of use, modularity, scalability, and community support.
